# SarsCov2_Snakemake_Pipeline
This is a snakemake pipeline used for analyse SarsCov2 sequence data generated by illumina machine.
This pipelien was based on [ARTIC network's fieldbioinformatics tools](https://github.com/artic-network/fieldbioinformatics), [Sars-CoV-2-NGS-pipeline](https://github.com/dridk/Sars-CoV-2-NGS-pipeline) and [ncov2019-artic-nf](https://github.com/connor-lab/ncov2019-artic-nf) with some updates:

1. `fastqc` and  was used to generate the qc report of input data.
2. `quast` was used to generate the sequence assembly report.
3. [pangolin](https://github.com/cov-lineages/pangolin) was used for the typing of SarsCov-2
4. `CorGat` was used to annotate the sequence, and generate alle frequency reports
You need to clone [CorGat](https://github.com/matteo14c/CorGAT) and specify the directory in the config files.
5. `multiqc` was used to generate the final report.

The workflow shows like below:

A test_data file was provided to test the pipeline.
You may test the pipeline by dry-run
`snakemake -s sars2.smk -n` 
then run the pipeline:
`snakemake -s sars2.smk -j 4 --use-conda`

WARNING - THIS REPO IS UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT AND ITS BEHAVIOUR MAY CHANGE AT **ANY** TIME. 

PLEASE ENSURE THAT YOU READ BOTH THE README AND THE CONFIG FILE AND UNDERSTAND THE EFFECT OF THE OPTIONS ON YOUR DATA!
